# Creating a Collection

_If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see_ [Importing Collections](../import-or-export-data/importing-collections).

<!-- /getting-started/import-or-export-data/importing-collections   docs\getting-started\import-or-export-data\importing-collections.md-->

Create a collection by selecting `Create Collection` from the **home screen** or **top left corner** of the app.

A popup dialog will appear, asking you to name your collection and choose its location in the file system. You can also choose to edit the generated folder's name.
