# Run a Collection

Running your Bruno Collection allows you to interact with, and test, an API. We allow you to run your Collections in a few different ways.

## Collection Runner

We have a built-in Collection Runner that allows for **unlimited** runs.

Run your Collection by either clicking the `...` button next to your Collection in the sidebar, then select `Run`.

Or click the Collection Runner icon in the top bar of the application.

You'll now have access to run the collection, add parameters, or set a delay between requests.

> _Data-driven testing by using a `.CSV` file is available in our Golden and Ultimate Edition._

## Automating Runs in CI/CD

Bruno offers a command-line utility to run Collections. This allows you to integrate your tests into a CI and build process.
