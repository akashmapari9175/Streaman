It's very common that users need to export their Bruno collections for backup, sharing, or migration to another tool.

Whatever the case, you can export the following formats from Bruno Collections:

- Bruno Collection (native format)
- Postman Collection
- OpenAPI V3 file
- OpenAPI V3 URL
- Insomnia Collection

> **Note:** Exporting as OpenAPI V3 and Insomnia Collection is available in our **Pro and Ultimate Editions**.  
> Please see [Collaboration in Bruno](#) for more details.
