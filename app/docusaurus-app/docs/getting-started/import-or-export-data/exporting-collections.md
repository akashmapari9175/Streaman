# Exporting Collections

If your whole team isn't using Bruno (yet), no fear! You can export Bruno collections to other formats.

Our preferred recommendation for sharing collections is using native Git versioning, but we realize there are other scenarios where exporting makes sense.

Bruno allows you to export as:

- **Bruno Collection**
- **Postman Collection**
- **OpenAPI Specification**

:::info
Exporting as an OpenAPI Specification is only available in our Golden and Ultimate Editions.
:::

## How to Export a Collection

To export a collection, follow these steps:

1. Hover over the Collection you want to export.
2. Click the `...` menu next to the collection.
3. Select **Export** from the dropdown.

## Export Dialog

Once you select **Export**, a dialog box will appear allowing you to choose the format:

- Bruno Collection (`.bruno`)
- Postman Collection (`.json`)
- OpenAPI Specification (`.yaml` / `.json`) _(Golden & Ultimate Editions only)_

You can then select the format and choose a location to save the exported file.
