# Feedback & Community

Bruno is building a community of API practitioners who want to challenge the state of tooling available. Our roadmap and releases are driven by your feedback and, as an open-source project, sometimes directly from your PRs.

Help us continue building the most powerful, logical, and dev-friendly API tool available today!
